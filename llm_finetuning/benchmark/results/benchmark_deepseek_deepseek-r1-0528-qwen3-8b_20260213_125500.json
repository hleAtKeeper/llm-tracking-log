So for minimization, we go downhill.\n\n- Commonly used in training neural networks to adjust weights and biases.\n\nNow, I should break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with some initial values for the parameters (like weights) of the model.

Python has tons of libraries that cater to different aspects\u2014data manipulation, ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This might be important for someone building a project quickly without reinventing the wheel.\n\nThird, community support. When you hit problems, forums and groups can be lifesavers.
